    <!--Main Body 1 (Intro and List)-->
    <div class="mainbody">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello and welcome to my DIY website! It's a little rough around the
            edges but I tried my best to make it look good using just what I know and coding tools. This page is for my
            final project so there will be a couple of odd things scattered throughout as well as odd styles or fonts
            but overall, it should be coherent.
            I chose to make this website because I want a good grade, I couldn’t think of anything else, and because I
            really enjoy this series. Do be aware, I’ve never done a movie or show review before so this is a bit rough.
            Prior to its release, Disney had just released its series “Obi Wan Kenobi” which was poorly received, and
            quite frankly, was lazily done. Interest in Star Wars media had died down, and many people were turned away
            from Star Wars as a brand. It became the general sentiment that if the producers had screwed up this bad on
            something so well known and beloved, then surely, they would also fumble with this next series. Cassian
            Andor was also a poorly known character, only appearing in one spin-off movie, though playing a rather large
            role in it. Many, myself included, did not see the purpose of this new TV series. It seemed more like yet
            another squeeze of the cash cow attempting to get as many dollars as possible from the poor saps who enjoy
            Star Wars. Inevitably upon its release it was not popular, as in not many people watched it. However, those
            who did watch were largely surprised at the quality of the series. Though slow paced, it tells a brilliant
            story of an apathetic petty crook slowly turning into a full-blown insurgent, seeking to tear down the cold,
            tyrannical regime that clutches the galaxy in its iron fist. It also tells the story of many different
            people, the rebellion as a whole, and focuses on their sacrifices for this same cause. I believe this show
            is vastly underrated and is one of the best pieces of media to be added to Star Wars. There are objective
            evidences that can be used or shown to prove this, and I will structure and explain them as follows:</p>

    <!--Main Body 2 (Cinematography and Directing)-->
    <div class="mainbody2">
        <b>Cinematography:</b> <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cinematography is quite brilliant in Andor. A lot of the sets
            or settings were done with practical effects or in on-set locations with a mix of added CGI. Such as the
            highlands of Scotland being used to film a whole 3 episodes. Most filming was done in person, making the
            visuals feel realistic, rustic, and very gritty. The visuals also have an effect on the setting itself.
            Ferrix, a ship repair and mechanics centered planet feels and looks dirty, grimy, and old. Without saying a
            single word, through just the usage of visuals, the show was able to portray all of this about a single
            setting or town. It does the same with other settings such as the ISB headquarters, and the imperial prison
            factory facility. Each is of those sets are unnaturally sleek, clean, and shiny. It breeds a sense of
            discomfort and a feeling that it is unnatural just because the setting looks so sterile and unwelcoming.
            There is also a great deal of attention to detail. When visuals are used, there is often a lot of detail put
            into it, such as the imperial dam and the meteor event called “the eye.” Every shot has plenty of details
            for one to search for and find, as well as enjoy the overall beautiful shots the directors and visual
            artists made. It is obvious that a lot of time was spent on the visuals, and that those who worked on them
            cared. This attention to detail makes the shots look real and lived in.
            The visual effect artists also do a great job of immersing their audience into the setting using these
            visuals. The camera is used and placed in such a way that that the audience views the settings and visuals
            mostly from a perspective akin to being there in person. There are no large bird’s eye view of any settings
            or large impossible panoramic shots and this immerses the audience into the show as it makes feel more
            realistic. This is also done with a clever use of practical and visual effects. Whenever a shot is
            established, it focuses on the practical set or props to make the visual add-ins feel more real or at least
            take the focus off of the add-ins. It also helps the audience know what to focus on and are sometimes used
            to tell a story of its own. This ties into directing.
        </p><br>
        <b>Directing:</b> <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directing is what a director does or emphasizes in certain scenes
            that usually isn’t in the script. For example, a script could just say “the characters run down stairs.”
            This could be done in slow-motion, with shaky cam, or like the grand shot of the Fellowship running down the
            last remaining stairs in the Mines of Moria. What the director chooses to do or emphasize with this shot or
            line from the script is essentially the definition of directing I’ll be using here. What is incredibly
            enjoyable about the directing in Andor is that it doesn’t hit the audience over the head, it allows the
            audience to figure things out for themselves. I’ll give more examples in the next paragraph, but in each of
            these examples, the choice of emphasis is subtle. No clues are thrown in the faces of the audience, they are
            left to notice it for themselves. One such example is when the character Luthen is directly caught up in the
            massacre on Ferrix. Previously he had hoped for oppression, believing it would spark more rebellion, and
            openly admitted to wanting people to suffer so that they would rebel and usurp the empire. However, when he
            is caught in an explosion during a riot on Ferrix, he visibly seems scared and immediately flees the scene.
            Shortly thereafter, there’s a shot of him staring blankly, seeming almost regretful, at the road where the
            riot is. He stares, and all that is heard is screaming, alarms, and blaster fire. The emphasis here seems to
            be that he got what he wanted, but was now somewhat regretful of it. It’s subtle, unspoken, and just shown.
            The directing in Andor again pays great attention to detail and is often done in a way that tells a story of
            its own. One such example is when Cassian receives a manifesto from a rebel idealist who dies in a fight
            with the empire. When he is given it, he refuses, stating that he doesn’t want it. He doesn’t care for it,
            he just wants his money and be on his way, but after being convinced, he takes it rather untrustingly. This
            same manifesto is shown again later, but it always remains closed, showing that Cassian still doesn’t care.
            In one shot he even accidentally opens it before quickly shutting it again. It isn’t until the finale that
            he actually sits and listens to it. The manifesto sort of portrays his interest in rebellion, first being
            hesitant and wary of it, before eventually embracing it. Details like this are scattered throughout the
            series, and it’s quite rewarding to be able to go back and see them when you might have missed it initially.
            Another example is of Cassian and this same rebel idealist talking. If one were to focus on what the
            director emphasizes, they could easily spot it, and know what message is being shared or shown through it.

    <!--Main Body 3 (Characters and Dialogue)-->
    <div class="mainbody3">
        <b>Characters:</b> <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This show also has amazing characters. There are a lot of
            characters that this series follows, or are simply involved, and each feels unique and realistic. Even the
            imperial perspective is shown through these characters. The differences between these characters are not
            spotlighted, nor do these characters feel shoehorned into the overall story. They feel as though they belong
            in the setting they’re in, and behave accordingly. Because of its rather slow pace, the audience is given a
            fair amount of time to get to know or understand characters individually. Though to varying degrees or
            amounts. This allows the audience to sympathize with these characters, or even hate these characters. Thus,
            the sacrifices, deaths, and dialogue of these characters feels all the more powerful and meaningful.
            One aspect of characters that the show nails is that they feel realistic and their goals are often
            realistic. They are shown eating, drinking, suffering, enjoying life, and arguably most importantly, are
            often shown fearing death or harm. At no point does any character stand boldly before death, staring it in
            the eyes and intimidating death into cowardice. Even zealots and fanatics are shown fearing death or pain.
            It feels so real because that’s just basic human nature. There is also a moral ambiguity to each character,
            each does bad things for both good and bad reasons. No character is a white knight hero, they’re human, and
            they differ in morals and sometimes go against their own morals. These characters are also flawed, even the
            pure idealist was too trusting of others, and was too naïve or assuming of other’s goals or intentions. But
            because the audience is given time to know these characters and their goals, they understand their
            perspective whether or not they agree with it.
            Another way characters are done so well is that they all make sacrifices and suffer to some degree or
            another. No individual goes through life without suffering to some extent. Especially not when they’re going
            against the flow per se, and are actively inviting opposition. Such as, again, the rebel idealist who was
            rebelling against the empire for the right reasons, and was doing it for selfless reasons. He feared death,
            he had to eat and drink abysmal tasting foods and drinks, was forced to camp for months just for one heist,
            and ultimately died during that heist. In some other shows he would likely have been portrayed as flawless,
            and his martyrdom would have sparked some massive movement or always remembered. But after his death, his
            supposed friends started contemplating taking the money for themselves and leaving him to die. He isn’t even
            mentioned again after his death. Again, this show does its characters so well because they feel so real and
            have a great deal of unique depth to them.
        </p><br>
        <b>Dialogue:</b> <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the dialogue is also amazing. Again, its so great because
            it feels so real. The dialogue has a natural flow to it, it feels as though it was something that would be
            said by people in this setting, not just what somebody would think they would say, or dramatic one-liners.
            One such example is in the pilot episode where Cassian kills two police officers and comes back to talk to
            his friend to create a fake alibi. He never says what he did or why he needs an alibi, but his friend grimly
            asks why he needs an alibi, is never given a reason, then corrects Cassian’s alibi and improves it before
            then telling Cassian that he should check on his mom and actually work for once. With just this interaction
            it establishes that they’re both good friends, know each other, trust each other, and care enough to cover
            the other even in really bad situations. It feels like something two good friends would say to each other.
            The dialogue also doesn’t use filler. The audience must pay attention to what is being said because what is
            said has weight to it, and is sometimes even written eloquently. The greatest example of this in this series
            is when Luthen explains what he sacrifices to the rebellion when questioned by a rat working for him. He
            explains that he’s given up all decency, any chance for a normal life, and sacrifices all he has and is to a
            cause or an end he knows he’ll never see. Here is the scene itself, I would definitely recommend watching
            it! It speaks for itself.

        <b>Outro:</b><br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I may not be the best at reviewing shows, there is concrete
            evidence that this show is good, or at the very least, had a lot of thought, creativity, and work put into
            it. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys darker, more mature shows as this shows the gritty
            truths of tyranny, rebellion, and conflicts. It does have its flaws, but overall, it’s an amazing show!</p>

        If you're reading this, I hope you're having a good day! This project took me a while and I did my best. In case
        you missed it, the links to the other pages are in the top left. I tried to make them pretty visable without
        making them ugly. There are a few things more that I would've liked to have done but I'm limited in my own
        knowledge and understanding of html and css. I'm really proud of my resume though, it took me a lot longer to finish that than I expected
        because I edited it to be more compact. Finding the right css to edit or change was like trying to find a couple of needles in a haystack.
        It was difficult and tedious at times, but what project isn't? What's funny is that it
        took me a fraction of the amount of time to write out all of those paragraphs than it took me it took to write
        the code. But overall, I enjoyed this project!
